dexsanity's first major update is here! now on top of red and blue, you can bring your pokemania to the johto region as well!
with this new update comes two new yaml options, but i'll go over ALL of the options in detal
---*GENERAL RULES*---
-for each pair of games, you start out with one of the games, and the other is an item that gets shuffled into the item pool. 
-for each generation, you're given water, fire, or grass as a starting type, and the rest of the types get shuffled into the item pool just like the alternate game version. 
-in order to catch a pokemon, you need to have it's type. for dual type pokemon, you need BOTH TYPES. so for charmeleon, you only need fire, but charizard requires fire AND flying
-all pokeball types (except for the standard pokeball) are items that you need to recieve before you can use them. so you can't use great balls until you get the great ball item, but once you do, you can use as many as you want
-if you don't have one of the two versions in a pair, you are allowed (and encouraged) to pair up with someone who does have the other version and work together to knock out- er, i mean, *catch* checks
---gen1---
this enables red and blue to be played. you start out with either a red cartridge or a blue cartridge, and either gen 1 fire, or gen 1 water. bulbasaur is grass/poison, so it had to be excluded, unfortunately :,(
---gen2---
this, of course, enables gold and silver to be played. you start with either a gold cartrige or a silver cartridge, and fortunately, all three johto starters are monotyped, so you'll start out with gen 2's water, grass, or fire
---limited run pokemon---
this option adds in pokemon that aren't currently publicly availalbe, and where obtainable through distribution events, glitches, etc. 
as of this build, there's now a whopping TWO pokemon that this applies to, gen 1 mew and gen 2 celebi.
having this option on adds a game shark item to the item pool. once you've recieved both it and the corresponding type/types for the limited run pokemon you want, you may either catch it through whatever means are available to you
oooooor you can just send out the check and say that you got it. that works too.
---obnoxious pokemon---
leaving this on will include a pkhex item, used for obtaining specific pokemon that are particularly annoying, and no, i don't mean 1% encounter rates. currently this only includes the roaming beasts (raikou, entei, and suicune),
and most stone evolution pokemon, which includes nidoking, nidoqueen, clefable, wigglytuff, poliwrath, victreebell, cloyster, exeggutor, vaporeon, jolteon, flareon, bellosom, and sunflora
the pkhex item functions exactly like how the game shark item does, just with the obnoxious pokemon instead of the limited run pokemon
---alphabet soup---
also known as unownsanity, this causes ALL forms of unown to be counted as their own seperate checks for EACH generation you have on (obviously, it won't work if you don't include a generation that has unown catchable)
---trade evolutions---
each generation gets its own link cable item and each generation from gen 2 onwards has an item called "held evolution items"
you need the link cable to trade pokemon, even if it's an in game trade with an npc, and you need the held evolution items get the evolutions that require trading while holding an item (like slowking or steelix)
if you turn this option off, it removes all trade evolution pokemon, but you still need the link cable in order to make trades with other players or to make in game trades with NPCs
