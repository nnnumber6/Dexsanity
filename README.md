This is the first ever build of my dexsanity manual. it only includes red and blue. yellow can be played, but it isn't accounted for in logic, so I'd reccomend only playing it alongside the other 2 versions.
you can also play this with 2 or more people, or just by yourself (this is partially for people who have one version, but not the other)

all pokemon require that you have their type before you can catch them (dual type pokemon require you to have BOTH types)

you start out with a random gameboy cart (which gives access to its respective version) and a random type (fire or water. bulbasaur has 2 types, so was unfortunately excluded)

there are 3 checks for HM moves. this was mostly just to prevent you from being unable to obtain a pokemon that can learn an HM move before it's required. just grab the corresponding location when you get a pokemon that can learn that move

the safari license is an item you need in order to enter the safari zone, and the locatioin requires you to have the item and be able to actually access the safari zone

limtited run pokemon are pokemon that used to be available through distributionis or events, but are now largely unavailable to the public. mew is the only example of this in gen 1
leaving the option on will add a game shark item to the item pool. 
once you have it, you're free too utilize glitches, cheats or any other methods you'd like to obtain a pokemon you normally wouldn't be able to (you WILL still need the corresponding types for the pokemon you want)
you can also use this to obtain pokemon you can only get one of if you'd like (such as whatever eevee evolution/evolutions you didn't pick)
